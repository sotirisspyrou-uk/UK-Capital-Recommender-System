## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager
- UK business market knowledge (helpful)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/capital-recommender.git
   cd capital-recommender
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create required directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data logs
   ```

4. **Run the system:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

- **Scoring weights** for recommendation algorithm
- **UK market data** (sectors, regions, funding types)
- **Performance settings** (timeouts, cache duration)
- **Broker commission structures**

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from main import CapitalRecommenderOrchestrator

# Initialize the system
orchestrator = CapitalRecommenderOrchestrator()

# Define business profile
business_data = {
    "company_name": "TechStart Solutions Ltd",
    "sector": "technology",
    "annual_revenue": 450000,
    "employees": 12,
    "location": "london",
    "business_age": 3,
    "funding_amount": 250000,
    "funding_purpose": "expansion",
    "timeline": "3_months"
}

# Get recommendations
result = orchestrator.process_recommendation_request(business_data)

# Display results
if result.success:
    print(f"Generated {len(result.recommendations)} recommendations")
    for rec in result.recommendations:
        print(f"{rec['rank']}. {rec['funding_source']} - {rec['match_score']}")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
from config import CONFIG, SCORING_WEIGHTS

# Adjust scoring weights
SCORING_WEIGHTS["commercial_value"] = 0.25  # Increase broker focus
SCORING_WEIGHTS["compatibility"] = 0.35     # Reduce compatibility weight

# Modify recommendation limits
CONFIG.MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS = 3
CONFIG.MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 0.7
```
